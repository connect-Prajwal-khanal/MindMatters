🧠 ADHD Web App – Developer Roadmap (with Django)


🎯 PHASE 1 – Core MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
🎨 1. Set up your Django project
Install Django: pip install django

Create project: django-admin startproject adhd_app

Create app: python manage.py startapp core

Set up templates, static files, and SQLite DB

📋 2. Questionnaire System
Create a model: Question, Option, UserAnswer

Create a form for users to answer questions

Store responses in the database

Score calculation logic in backend (e.g., low / moderate / high ADHD signs)

📈 3. Result Page
Show user results and some basic explanation

Include chart or gauge using Chart.js for better visuals

🧪 4. Local Testing + Iteration
Test with a few users (friends, family)

Gather feedback and improve wording/UI

🌱 PHASE 2 – Grow & Personalize
👤 5. User Accounts (Optional for MVP, Required for Full Product)
Enable login/register (Django auth)

Link answers to user accounts

Add password reset, profile page, etc.

📊 6. Progress Tracking
Let users take the test multiple times

Save each result with timestamp

Show progress graph (e.g., "how you’ve improved")

📚 7. Personalized Resources
Create a model: Resource (title, category, content, link)

Recommend resources based on user type or score

Include ADHD-friendly tools (pomodoro timer, to-do list)

🧠 8. Calming/Interactive Features
Add sensory-friendly themes or calming visuals (CSS themes)

Guided audio/video section (use YouTube embeds)

Add light interactivity (countdowns, mood check-ins)

🧰 PHASE 3 – Professional & Scalable
🔐 9. Data Privacy
Use encryption for sensitive user data

Let users export/delete their data (GDPR-style features)

Include a privacy policy

🚀 10. Deployment
Set up PostgreSQL as the DB

Deploy on Render, Railway, Fly.io, or Heroku

Set up custom domain & HTTPS

🌍 11. Marketing & Outreach
Add a blog page: “What is ADHD?”, “How to get help”, etc.

SEO + social sharing metadata

Start building a brand: logo, color scheme, mission

📦 12. Future Plans (Optional)
Mobile app (Django + REST API + Flutter/React Native)

AI chatbot integration (with OpenAI or custom NLP)

Collaborate with professionals (therapists, educators)
